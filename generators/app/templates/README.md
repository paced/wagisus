## Staging and Versioning

There is no staging and versioning to speak of in this marketing profile project. The CI/CD script at `.gitlab-ci.yml` will build, run code quality, and use Google App Engine to deploy on each commit to the `master` branch.

### Setting up CI/CD

1. Set up a project with Google App Engine active (Node Flexible Environment) in-browser or otherwise.
2. Set up a new Service Account with the Editor role and extract a JSON key.
3. Set the JSON key as DEPLOY_KEY_FILE in GitLab.
4. Set the project ID as PROJECT_ID in GitLab.
5. Optionally, set up a custom domain in Google App Engine.

That's it, hopefully. Please raise an issue if this seems wrong.

## Required Project Changes

These must be done manually for the application to work properly.

1. Add favicons as required: `static/favicon.ico`, `static/favicon-16x16.png`, and `static/favicon-32x32.png`.
2. Add `assets/images/site-image.png` or whatever social image file you pointed to in generation.

### Optional Project Changes

1. Edit security middleware.
2. Edit `robots.txt`.
3. Edit the CI/CD script.
